    <p>A few notes from the session at AWS Loft 2019 regarding <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh" title="AWS AppMesh">AWS AppMesh</a> as their service mesh offering and common use cases; slides can be fetched <a href="https://emea-resources.awscloud.com/stockholm-loft-2019-containers/containers-day-appmesh" title="Presentation slides">here</a> from
the AWS EMEA Resources site.</p>
<p>It seems that the applications so far are around deployments, by providing mechanism that enable to us to conduct them in an agile,
flexible yet robust way; the mesh is used to control the traffic flow as part of the deployment process, i.e. <em>Canary Releases</em>, <em>0-downtime</em> deployments
by following a <em>Blue/Green approach</em>.</p>
<p>It was strange however, that application resiliency wasn&rsquo;t part of the use cases reviewed, they were in fact barely mentioned; patterns such
as <em>Circuit-Breaker</em> are still on the road map of features to come (at the time of this writing), it supports basic patterns such as <em>Retries</em> and <em>Exponential Back-Off</em>.</p>
<h2 id="features-and-applications">Features and applications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obervability</strong> and control of Application-level communication.</li>
<li>Provides mechanism for <strong>Failure isolation/protection</strong> (resiliency).</li>
<li>Proxy-based node management, a proxy exists as a sidecar on every virtual node.</li>
<li>Features for <strong>Tracing</strong> and <strong>Logging</strong>.</li>
<li>Fine-grained deployment control by managing/shaping client-side traffic and routing, i.e. <em>Canary Releases</em> or <em>Blue/Green</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="app-mesh-components">App Mesh components:</h3>
<p>Captured some of the key elements and buzzwords comprising the Service.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mesh name.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/virtual_nodes.html" title="AWS AppMesh - Virtual Nodes">Virtual nodes</a> (actual functioning services)
<ul>
<li>Backend</li>
<li>Service discovery</li>
<li>Listener</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Routes</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-appmesh-virtualservice.html" title="AWS AppMesh - Virtual Services">Virtual Service</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://flagger.app/" title="Flagger App">Flagger</a> was quick-demoed to demonstrate <em>Canary Releases</em>, the <strong>value added</strong> to a mesh is that it enables us to <strong>automate</strong>, requiring virtually no human intervention
in order to control the routing to and from nodes based on the results as it makes progress.</p>
<h2 id="remarks">Remarks</h2>
<ul>
<li>As expected being an AWS offering, it works across various computing services: <em>ECS</em>, <em>Fargate</em>, <em>EKS</em>, <em>EC2</em> and <em>K8s on EC2</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" title="Envoy Proxy">Envoy Proxy</a> is used under the hood.</li>
<li>Main actors/elements are <em>Virtual Nodes</em>, <em>Virtual Services</em> and <em>Routes</em>.</li>
</ul>
