  <div class="text">
    <p>Lately I have had the opportunity to play with <a href="https://golang.org" title="Go Lang">Go</a> and so far I am quite impressed, I have barely started using it thus only touched the surface, from the design principles behind the language to its basic syntax and structure.</p>
<p>On a personal note, it is truly important to me to understand a language before using it, from its basics to how it works internally, this ensures that we use it optimally and get the best out of it; the supporting community plays an important role, no doubt, the numerous resources shared to help new users get started right away, but also, guide us to make use of language they way it is meant to, in order to meet expectations.</p>
<p>Even though the resources are numerous and easy to come by, the following are the ones I felt helped me the most as I got started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://golang.org" title="Go Lang">Go Lang official site</a>, not much to say, the official language site, great index to other helpful resources.</li>
<li><a href="https://godocs.org" title="Go Docs">Go Doc</a>, detailed documentation from the built-in commands, standard packages and others.</li>
<li><a href="https://gobyexample.com" title="Go by Example">Go by Example</a>, self-explanatory, super helpful as a quick ref and cookbook.</li>
<li><a href="https://dmitri.shuralyov.com/idiomatic-go#use-consistent-spelling-of-certain-words" title="A guide to Idiomatic Go">Idiomatic Go</a>, How to write programs in Go they we are supposed to.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments" title="Go Code review comments">Go Code Review comments</a>, Some things to look out for when reviewing code, at the same time, they are also rules to keep in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>I may expand the list above as I come across more.</p>
